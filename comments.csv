"There are news channels allowing an AI system to add an article title to their videos, to be uploaded to Youtube. So the title may say one thing, but the thumbnail of the video is to something completely unrelated.<br>I finally had enough from 1 local channel. They eventually earned too many strikes and Youtube (Google) finally took action against them. So the news channel recreated themselves so to speak, changed their brand color, image design, etc, and I&#39;ve had to reblock them because they&#39;re now even more untrustworthy.<br>So much so even the search engine of  Duck Duck Go no longer shows news articles from them! Now that&#39;s a small win against fake news media but it&#39;s much better than taking no action at all.<br><br>So there is a growing awareness to take action against news media who continue to abuse AI systems to create false news to gain views, which is what keeps a news station going. If they don&#39;t keep a steady amount of viewers year after year, they could end up being closing down.",non-toxic,0.9990628361701965

"The key to detecting lies and misinformation is to take great care of your internal compass.  Your conscience.  Keep it clean. Stop ignoring it when it condemns what you are doing.  Instead change what you are doing.  Stop searing it with the hot irons of denial.  If your conscience bothers you there is a reason.  Don’t let others tell you that it’s ok when you know it is not.  <br><br>You will always filter the things you hear, read, and see through your conscience.  If it is clean and strong it is virtually impossible to be lied to successfully.",non-toxic,0.9982226490974426
