"There are news channels allowing an AI system to add an article title to their videos, to be uploaded to Youtube. So the title may say one thing, but the thumbnail of the video is to something completely unrelated.<br>I finally had enough from 1 local channel. They eventually earned too many strikes and Youtube (Google) finally took action against them. So the news channel recreated themselves so to speak, changed their brand color, image design, etc, and I&#39;ve had to reblock them because they&#39;re now even more untrustworthy.<br>So much so even the search engine of  Duck Duck Go no longer shows news articles from them! Now that&#39;s a small win against fake news media but it&#39;s much better than taking no action at all.<br><br>So there is a growing awareness to take action against news media who continue to abuse AI systems to create false news to gain views, which is what keeps a news station going.

That way any output from AI, (image, picture, song, voice, science, math) cannot be copyright , only a human can copyright the output, thus the copyright would apply to a person.   Copyright law (Title 17, U.S.C.), does not define the word ‚Äúauthor‚Äù,  so just define it as Human. <br>Just as the Constitution gives the USA NO authority to dictate to any country the type of weapons they can Have.
